# luhnTest
This program was a project in my computer science class that practices calling different methods throughout a program. It demonstrates the Luhn Test (aka Luhn's algorithm) to test if an
inputted credit card, based on its digits, is a valid credit card number or not. It then returns the result and repeats the process two (2) more times.
